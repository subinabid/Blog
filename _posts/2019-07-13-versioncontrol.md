For those who are new to the concept, version controlling is an efficient method of amintaining multiple versions of the same file. This is more significant when a team is working on the same file. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a commn tool used for version controlling and [Github](https://github.com/) is an easy to use free web service.  

I have been working on a critical document during last week and the document ran into multiple versions based on inputs from diffferent reviewers. Each version had multiple revisions. I ended up having 30 - 40 files getting confused every time.
