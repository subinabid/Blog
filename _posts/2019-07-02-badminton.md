I broke my badminton racket recently and decided to buy a new one. Did some research for the same and I thought i could share it. I have used the following badminton rackets:

|Racket|Weight|String|Tension|Remarks|
|------|------|------|------:|------|
|Nanospeed 500|3U|Stock|Stock| This is a heavy racket |
|Nanospeed 500|3U|BG 66 Ultimax|22 lbs| Loved these strings, Repulsion and sound |
|Nanospeed 500|3U|BG 66 Ultimax|23 lbs| |
|Voltric Lite|4U|Stock|stock| Head heavy racket |
|Voltric Lite|4U|BG 66 Ultimax|23 lbs|Felt the smashes were less powerful than my Nanospeed|
|Arcsaber 69 Lite|5U|Stock|stock|Super light weight |

All Items from [Yonex](http://yonex.com/) and for those who are new to badminton, 3U is heavier than 5U.


I just had one match with the Arcsaber, will update soon.

### For those who are trying to buy their first racket

1. There is no point in buying an expensive racket for beginers. Trust me, you get excellent rackets for Rs 1000 or even below. Just avoid the ones with T-joints 
2. Yonex makes nice ones, so does Li-ning, Ashaway, Apacs, Adidas, etc
3. Dont care about strings at the beginning. Whatever came with the racket is good for starters. Change it in 6 months or when you break it or when you feel its too loose. Yonex BG65 is a great string and 22 lbs is a decent tension. MAx tension will be printed on you r racket. It would cost you about Rs 350.
4. Mavis 10 is a good shuttle to start with
