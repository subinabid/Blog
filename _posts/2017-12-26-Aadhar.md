title: Aadhar and the non-mango people
---
[Gurcharan Das](http://gurcharandas.org/) in one of his books mentions the role of government should be **three** things and three things alone: 1. Maintain law and order 2. Provide healthcare and education 3. Develop infrastructure. If you aren't convinced, look at aadhar. It is the best example that the government shouldn't venture into anything else other than the 3 items - especially IT and computers.

I have an aadhar enrolled from the state of UP, with an address in Kerala and I currently live in Karnataka. I work for a PSU and its very likely that I will live in a few other states as well in my career. This did not bother me at all till our honorable prime minister decided to link aadhar with all the services - gas subsidies, bank account, PAN, mobile connections, Insurance policies etc etc. I dodged the demonetization bullet by cutting down my expenses, living with the few 100 rupee notes with me, opening a debt account at my regular eateries and paying with plastic wherever possible. But the aadhar bullet was too difficult to dodge!
