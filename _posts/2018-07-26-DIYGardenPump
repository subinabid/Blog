title: DIY home garden waterering system.
---

My wife & I grow a few potted plants in our balcony, which we call our private garden :) . We have an [Arduino uno](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-uno-rev3) board lying around the house and we decided to brush up our engineering skills and to make a water pumping system for our garden.
