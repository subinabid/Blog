title: GST, Coal & Power Tariff
---


The much awaited [GST was implemented][GST] bu the government recently and there were articles in all major news papers. The article that caught my attention was [regarding lowering of tax on coal from 11.69% to 5%][coal] which is supposed to lower the cost of electricity in the country where [60%][60] power generation is using coal. 

It makes me wonder, how much will the energy cost go down by this 57% reduction in taxes? Tariff is not determined by fuel prices alone. The cost of each unit of energy consumed has 2 parts:
1. Fixed cost (capital costs)
2. Variable cost (fuel cost mostly)

So where does coal price come into picture? The answer is in both heads.  

Lets dig deep into **fixed cost**. It consists of following subheads:

|Sl|Component|weightage|
|---|---|---|
|a |Return on Equity |15.50%|
|b |Interest on Loan Capital |As per actual|
|c |Depreciation |5.28%|
|d |Interest on ***Working Capital*** |Based on Normative Parameters|
|e |Operation & Maintenance Costs |Based on Normative Parameters|
|f |Cost of Secondary Oil |Based on Normative Parameters|
|g |Special allowance in lieu of R&M |Based on Plant life|

Item d, ***working capital*** allows the power plants to stock coal for 1 .5 months in case of pit head plants (*situated near a coal mine*) and 2 months in case of other plants. 

***Variable cost*** aka energy charges is for the recovery of **primary fuel** costs (*Primary fuel is **Coal**. There are secondary fuels in a power plant like light diesel oil, heavy fuel oil ets used during startup*)  

This was written keeping non power professionals in mind. Its very likely that the experts may have a different perspective. I would like to learn that, you may please [mail][mail] me
