title: Obsession with https

---
I have been obsessed with ***https*** for a while. I love the green padlock more than the *i* in a circle. SO ,when i created my personal site, this blog, and a portfoilo page, I wanted it to be served over https, rather than just http. Of course, I was not setting up a payment page or something that required the visitors to enter their bank or credit card details. But, still, the padlock gave a sense of security.
