I have been searching for a few phones on the internet for last 2 days and  now, every site i visit has an advertisenet for one of the phones i was looking for.

It was badminton rackets till a few days ago. I broke mine and was googling for some replacement and the ads were all rackets for a week.

It makes me wonder, how do i see this? Whats google saying exactly?

1. Looks like you were looking for phones, would you like to ***buy*** this?
2. Looks like you were looking for phones, would you like to buy ***this***?
3. Looks like you were looking for phones, There is an ***offer*** here?
4. Looks like you were looking for phones, There is an offer ***here***?
5. ***I know*** you were looking for phones
