title: Setting up my own website
---

All of a sudden I feel like setting up my own [website][web]!

Purchased the domain [subinabid.xyz][web] and setup a home page on Github Pages. [Jaseem][ja] recommended jekyll for the blog. If you are able to see this blog, then I have done well so far.

subinabid.com is officially mine!

[web]:http://subinabid.xyz
[ja]:http://haveyoumetjaseem.in/
