title: Setting up my own website

**11/05/2016**

All of a sudden I feel like setting up my own [website][web]!

Purchased the domain [subinabid.xyz][web] and setup a home page on Github Pages. [Jaseem][ja] recommended jekyll for the blog. If you are able to see this blog, then I have done well so far.

[subinabid.com](subinabid.com) is officially mine!.

I have been reading about [www vs bare domains](http://www.greenhills.co.uk/2011/06/12/www-or-bare-domain.html) recently. decided to go ahead with a bare domain. Minimal & neat, not a technical decision though.
