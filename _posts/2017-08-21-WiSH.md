I got the opportunity to work on an experimental wind + solar hybrid power project. It presents me with new learinings every day.

Solar panels in India will be facing south. The angle of inclination varries from season to season. 
>Why? Because we are on the **northern hemisphere.**

Solar modules are arranged into tables, each table consisting of 10 to 20 panels. Multiple tables are connected to a single circuit. The frame holding the table is calles a Module Mounting Structure (MMS) consisting of a column, rafter and braces which helps in changing the inclination of the table.

Columns are fixed to the ground using concrete.

Jigs are used to keep the columns in position before concreting.
