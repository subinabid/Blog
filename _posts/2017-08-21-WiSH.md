I got the opportunity to work on an experimental wind + solar hybrid power project. It presents me with new learinings every day.

Solar panels in India will be facing south. The angle of inclination varries from season to season. 
>Why? Because we are on the **northern hemisphere.**

Solar modules are arranged into tables. Table can hold a single panel for a small application or multiple pannels (*upto 30 maybe*) for a large application. Multiple tables are connected to a single circuit (*called SMB*). The frame holding the table is called a ***Module Mounting Structure (MMS)*** consisting of a column, rafter, braces (*which helps in changing the inclination of the table*), and purlin.

Columns are fixed to the ground using concrete.

Jigs are used to keep the columns in position before concreting.
