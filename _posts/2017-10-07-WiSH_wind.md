I am currently working on installation of a 2 MW wind turbine. Lets see how it goes:

**07/10/2017**

Wind turbine installation begins with excavation for the foundation. The bottom is levelled with plain cement concrete (PCC). The foundation bolts required to fix the wind turbine tower is kept in postion to be embeded inside reinforced cement concrete (RCC). To fix the bolts in position, 2 flanges (*top & bottom*) are used which will also be embeded inside the RCC

Meanwhile, the turbine blades are getting ready for despatch at the OEM.

Wind turbine blade size depends on the MW capacity of the machine. The current blade has a length of about 56 mtrs and weight about 11.5 ton per blade.

>The Largest wind turbine in the world has a diameter of about 176 mtr generating 9MW power (peak)

The blades are made of composites. They are hollow inside.
