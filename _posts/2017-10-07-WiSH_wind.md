I am currently working on installation of a 2 MW wind turbine. Lets see how it goes:

**07/10/2017**

Wind turbine installation begins with excavation for the foundation. The bottom is levelled with plain cement concrete (PCC). The foundation bolts required to fix the wind turbine tower is kept in postion to be embeded inside reinforced cement concrete (RCC). To fix the bolts in position, 2 flanges (*top & bottom*) are used which will also be embeded inside the RCC
